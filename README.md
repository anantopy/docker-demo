# Deep Dive on Everyday Docker Functionality

This repo contains demo files associated with [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eAQYxtanGTDo792iMQMz9WCmyWcTghyAoLZvF17nOjw/edit?usp=sharing).
It uses docker-compose and various linux tooling to demonstrate the following Docker features:

* CPU Shares
* CPU Quota
* Memory Limit
* Port Bindings
* PID Namespaces
* Users
* Volumes

Note that Docker For Mac and Docker For Windows provide limited visibility from the host.
Using a linux host is encouraged.
